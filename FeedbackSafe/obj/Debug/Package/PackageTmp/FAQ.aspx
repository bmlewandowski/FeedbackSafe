<a name="WhatIs"></a><strong>What is Feedback Safe?</strong>
<p>Feedback Safe is a secure service that allows organizations and its leaders to engage members in rich and anonymous conversation.</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />


<a name="HowDoes"></a><strong>How does it work?</strong>
<p>Once an organizational leader adds you as a member, you are emailed an anonymous key which you can use to login to Feedback Safe. At no time does the leader know who recieved what unique key, nor what member has engaged started a new conversation or added a new comment. Once you access Feedback Safe with your anonymous key, you can pick a leader to start a new conversation with, or read through and contribute to existing public conversations.</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="Anonymous"></a><strong>How am I kept anonymous?</strong>
<p>When an organizational leader adds members of his organization to Feedback Safe, they are assigned a unique Anonymous Key which is emailed to them. The login and all interactions can be handled with that unique key or by adding a password to your email address from your preferences. Regardless of how you access Feedback Safe, your identity is kept completely anonymous while interacting with leaders and other members in both public and private conversations.</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="YouKnow"></a><strong>But Feedback Safe still knows my idenitity right?</strong>
<p>While your name and email address is stored in the Feedback Safe database, it is not used in your interactions with organizational leaders or members. Feedback Safe only maintains your information so that it may notify you of responses and keep track of your private conversations (keeping your private conversations YOUR private conversations).</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="GiveAway"></a><strong>What if a Leader/Organization asks for the identity of an someone in the conversation?</strong>
<p>We tell them no. That isn't what we do, and would violate the purpose of Feedback Safe. Your anonymity is the core of what Feedback Safe was built around to allow you to engage in honest, open, and worry-free interaction. Organizations that desire non-anonymous conversations can utilize our other product: <strong><a href="http://www.feedbackopen.com" title="Feedback Open" target="_blank">Feedback Open</a></strong>, which also features our unique "Interaction Engine", but in a non-anonymous setting.</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="Private"></a><strong>Can I have private conversations?</strong>
<p>You sure can! When starting a conversation, you have the option to mark the conversation as private which keeps it just between you and the leader you selected without involving other members. Leaders also have the option to mark an existing public conversation as private at any time if desired.</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="Email"></a><strong>Can I limit or opt-out of email notifications?</strong>
<p>Absolutely. Feedback Safe has options for both Organizations and Members in their preferences to set notification options for various activities such as new conversations, new comments, or even opting-out of mail completely.</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="LostKey"></a><strong>What happens if I lose my Anonymous Key?</strong>
<p>You can always request your Anonymous Key using your email address from the <a href="/Recover.aspx" title="Recover Key">Recover Page</a>.</p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="Password"></a><strong>What happens if I add a password to my email?</strong>
<p>Adding a password to your email from your profile/preferences allows you to login to Feedback Safe without your Anonymous Key. It does NOT have any effect on your anonymity, but merely allows you to engage in conversation more quickly and easily. </p>
<a href="#top">top</a> <hr />

<a name="HowMuch"></a><strong>How much does it cost?</strong>
<p>Feedback Safe is completely free to members of a participating organization. Your organization is picking up the tab because they value your input, engagement, and anonymity. That means what you have to say is pretty important to them, and now you can share that with them in a rich and worry-free environment</p>
