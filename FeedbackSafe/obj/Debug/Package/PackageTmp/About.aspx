<p>How are you recieving your feedback?</p>
<p>Before now, the comment box stood as an organization's only real means of anonymous communication, and it is strictly one-way. Feedback Safe replaces stale one-off suggestions/comments with a live engaging conversation while protecting the identity of those involved.</p>
<p>Feedback Safe provides a new way for you to connect with members of your organization in a safe, secure, and anonymous environment. Using Feedback Safe gives you insight to issues before they become serious problems as anonymity and privacy encourage honest and worry-free interaction.</p>
<p>By using Feedback Safe, you are providing a safe and trusted avenue of connecting and communicating with members of your organization that is both easy to use and easy to manage. By utilizing a hosted third-party you are using a proxy to handle the interaction of the communication while keeping the veil of anonymity intact.</p>
<p>Offing both public and private conversations with an organizational leader, Feedback Safe removes the barriers of communication and allows you to stay on top of things. Ease your workload by directing certain problems/complaints/suggestions to Feedback Safe.</p>
<p>For organizations who desire the interaction engine of Feedback Safe, but not nessasarily the anonymity, we also offer <strong><a href="http://www.feedbackopen.com" title="Feedback Open" target="_blank">Feedback Open</a></strong>.</p>
